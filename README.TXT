INTRODUCTION TO THE REALMS

Welcome to the Forgotten Realms, the most successful and appreciated
fantasy world created for game players.  From fertile inspiration to
limitless land of fancy, the Realms have grown over the years into the
prize gem of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons multi-verse.  Join us now
for a quest into the Forgotten Realms unlike any that has ever been
undertaken.

Blood & Magic takes place in an era of the Realms which has never
before been revealed.  It is before the Time of Troubles, in the land
to the east of the Great Sea, where powerful leaders create magical
armies to do battle with their enemies.  This arcane practice is made
possible by the Bloodforge, a mysterious artifact which forms living
golems out of raw magic.

You will assume the role of various mages who have mastered the
Bloodforge.  Court intrigue, rivalries, revenge and outright invasion
will draw you into conflicts with other masters of the art.  Your
campaigns will bring you to winding city streets, remote wilderness
camps, forgotten ruins of yore, and sites conjured straight out of
myth.

So leave your parties in the dungeon and your heroes on the quest, and
prepare yourself for the ultimate challenge... to conquer a realm by
way of Blood & Magic.

GETTING STARTED

To start the game from the DOS prompt, make C:\INTRPLAY\BAM your
current directory (or change to the directory where Blood & Magic is
located), type "BAM", then press <ENTER>.  To start the game under
Windows '95, open the INTERPLAY folder, then double-click on the Blood
& Magic icon.  You will see a series of cinematic sequences, followed
by the Main Menu.  You can bypass any cinematic in the game by 
pressing <ESC>.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** MAIN MENU ***

SINGLE PLAYER
Use this option to play against the computer.  In this version, we
have provided two unrelated scenarios.  In the full version, you can
either choose a preset story, or create a customized character for a
Random Campaign.

TWO PLAYER
In the full version of the game, this option may be used to begin a
head-to-head game with a live opponent.  A two player game may be
played over a network, via modem, or with a direct link connection.

TUTORIAL
The tutorial is designed to teach new users the basics for playing
Blood & Magic.

bring you this quality product.

REPLAY INTRO
Use this option to view the Blood & Magic introduction.

LEAVE GAME
This returns you to either DOS or Windows, depending on where you were
when you started the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** SINGLE PLAYER MENU ***


NEW SCENARIO
This activates the Realm Map, which shows the region of the Forgotten
Realms where Blood & Magic takes place.  Pass your cursor over the
Realm Map to view the available scenarios, then select on the map to
begin a scenario.  We have provided two unrelated scenarios in this
version of the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

Making the most of pre-dawn light, your trusted followers prowl the
edge of the battlefield in search of suitable terrain.  They release
their heavy burden in a level clearing, and quickly set about their
most urgent task.  Your Bloodforge is fixed into the earth before the
first rays of golden light touch the spires of the enemy stronghold.
To calm your nerves, you recite the principles of warfare as
instructed by the Great Mage.

"The Bloodforge is the mother of battle.  It is pregnant with magic
which grants life to my army.  We of the faith call this power mana,
the food which nourishes our practice.

"Basal Golems are the children of battle.  They are formed from the
mana in my Bloodforge, and serve my great purpose without question or
regret.  When they are idle, their meditations gather mana to supply
our cause.

"The mystical sites are the temples of battle.  My followers erect
them to honor the gods.  In exchange for this homage, our Golems may
transcend their meager forms when they visit these sacred shrines.

"I am the master of battle.  Through the rights of conflict I shall
achieve great ends.  My position is not on the field of battle, but in
that high place where all its glory can be surveyed.  My commands are
not issued by writ or by proxy, but with a marble oracle created by
the Great Mage.  Such are his teachings of its use..."

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** THE ORACLE INTERFACE ***

The oracle interface consists of a Level Map, Action Window, Command
Bar, Message Window, and several gauges and option buttons.  The Info
Button can be selected on any subject within the Action Window or on
any interface feature to learn more about it.  The Info Button and 
Tutorial provide excellent methods for becoming familiar with Blood & Magic.

LEVEL MAP AND ACTION WINDOW
The Level Map shows an overhead representation of the entire
battlefield.  As your followers explore this level, more of the map is
revealed.  The green box on the Level Map shows where the Action
Window is currently centered.  To center the Action Window at a new
location, either select within the Level Map, scroll the window using
your <Arrow Keys>, or scroll the window by moving your mouse cursor to
the very edge of the screen.

COMMAND BAR / GIVING COMMANDS
Left-click on any Action Window subject to select it.  It will become
the active subject in the Command Bar.  If you select one of your own
followers, then command buttons will appear in the Command Bar.  Left-
click on one of these command buttons, and then left-click a target in
the Action Window.  Your follower will now execute that command with
regard to that target.
	  
	  Examples:

	  Left-click your follower, then left-click the Move To button,
	  then left-click any location within the Action Window.  Your
	  follower attempts to move to that target location.

	  Left-click your follower, then left-click the Attack button, then
	  left-click any creature within the Action Window.  Your follower
	  moves to and attempts to attack that target creature.

You can also use commands on targets which appear on the Level Map.
This is useful for targeting a subject which is not currently shown in
the Action Window.  As you will learn, some commands will not work in
combination with some targets.  In addition, some skills and spells
will not work without mana.  If you select a command button, then wish
to exit that mode (cancel the command), simply right-click or press
<ESC>.  This method will cancel most any game mode or menu.

DEFAULT COMMANDS
You can quickly issue default commands to your followers.  To do this,
left-click one of your own followers, and then right-click on a target
within the Action Window.  Your follower will execute the most logical
action with regard to that target.


REPEAT COMMAND
If you issue a command to one of your followers, and you want to
repeat that same command to others, then hold down the <CTRL> key
while left-clicking on the subsequent followers.  They will attempt to
execute the same command with regard to the same target subject.

GROUP COMMANDS
To solect a group of your followers, drag your mouse within the Action
Window while holding down left-click.  A targeting frame will be drawn
which you can use to surround your followers.  When you release the
left-click, all of your followers who are within the targeting frame
will be joined in a group.  You can now issue a single command to
every member of the group.

MESSAGE WINDOW
The oracle will send you messages during the battle pertaining to
important events.  These messages are spoken audibly and written in
the Message Window.  Select the Go See button to center the Action
Window on the most recent message event.

QUICK KEYS
Blood & Magic supports a number of "quick key" equivalents that you
can use to issue commands and select interface options.

F2     save game (Full Only)
F3     load game (Full Only)
?      info cursor
m      move to command
a      attack command
g      guard command

p      freeze action
Enter  go see message event
Tab    cycle to next follower
Esc    exit mode / options menu
Ctrl+LeftClick    repeat command to follower

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*** TEACHINGS OF THE GREAT MAGE ***

MANA
The fundamental resource in Blood & Magic is spell power, which we
call mana.  This resource is used to create followers, to transform
followers, to cast spells, and to activate some items.  When Basal
Golems are not moving or fighting, they revert to an obelisk form and
generate mana.  To acquire this mana for your own use, select one of
your Basal Golems (that is in obelisk form), and then select the
Transfer option.

THE BLOODFORGE
Your Bloodforge stores your mana supply, which can not exceed 300 at
any one time.  Due to its magical nature, your Bloodforge slowly
generates its own mana.  When you select your Bloodforge (the swirling
slab) within the Action Window, you are presented with a Basal Golem
option on the Command Bar.  If there is no creature on top of the
Bloodforge, then you can use this option to create a Golem.  You can
also revert a high level creature back into a Basal Golem by moving it
next to your Bloodforge, then choosing its Transform option.

THE MYSTICAL SITES
At the start of most levels, you will control a small number of
mystical sites.  You may transform your Basal Golems into higher level
creatures when they are next to one of your sites.  You can also fill
a foundation with Basal Golems, then transform them into a site of
your choice.

	  ARBOR LODGE
	  This is the primal sanctum of Chauntea, the goddess of nature.
	  Use this site to create creatures of the wild.
	  
	  BARRACKS
	  This martial hall serves Tempus, the god of war.  Use this site
	  to create veteran combatants.
	  
	  CRYPT
	  This is the macabre tomb of Myrkul, god of the dead.  This site
	  provides dreadful minions.
	  
	  RUNESTONE
	  This arcane post honors Mystra, the goddess of magic.  This site
	  is used to create beings who possess a strong magical essence.
	  
	  TEMPLE
	  This is the sacred shrine of Lathander, god of renewal and
	  virtue.  Use this site to create virtuous followers.
	  
EXPERIENCE AND RESEARCH
Because you are a great leader, you will gain valuable insight with
each achievement on the field of battle.  This insight accumulates in
the form of experience.  You will gain experience when your followers
cast spells, use items, create and destroy structures, defeat enemies
in battle, and accomplish scenario objectives.  Ultimately, you may
use your experience to research new abilities for transforming your
Basal Golems.  To do this, select the Research button in the upper
right corner of the oracle interface.

THE REALM MAP
This map shows the region of Faerun (the Forgotten Realms) where Blood
& Magic takes place.  It is to the East of the Great Sea, and borders
the land known as Kara-Tur.  In this version of the game, you can use
the map to select three unrelated scenarios.  In the full version, you 
may begin an epic story from the history of the Realms, or launch your 
own custom Legendary Campaign.

THE BATTLE ASSESSMENT
Your trusted advisors will keep account of each battle, and present
this information when you are victorious.  You will see an accurate
tally of your accomplishments, and you will receive a score for your
efforts based upon public opinion.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HINTS FOR BEGINNERS

Play the Tutorial, and use the ? Info Cursor and Encyclopedia
frequently during the game.

When you begin a new scenario, leave at least one Basal Golem in
obelisk form in order to steadily generate mana.  Remember to
periodically transfer mana from your Basal Golems to your Bloodforge.

If you have sufficient mana and Basal Golems to spare, then send your
Golems to your mystical sites and transform them into higher level
creatures.  Be certain to protect these sites from your opponent.

Every creature in Blood & Magic has inherent strengths and weaknesses.
Use your experience to research the abilities which support your
overall strategy, and don't hesitate to create any mystical sites
which you may need for this strategy.

Once you have created a reasonable defense force, steadily explore the
map by moving your followers into the "fogged-out" regions.  Have your
followers pick up items before your opponent discovers them.

When you encounter enemy creatures, assess their strengths and
abilities before you engage them in combat.  Heal your wounded
followers, and if they are close to death, then either transform them
back into Basal Golems, or remove them in exchange for some mana.

Remember your losing condition for the map!  All is lost if your
opponent successfully achieves this objective!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING

Q:  Why won't the game install on to my hard drive?
A:  Make sure that you have sufficient space available on your hard
	 drive for the installation (at least 35Mb).  Check that you are
	 running the INSTALL program from your CD-ROM drive, and that the demo
	 CD is in your drive.  It is typically safest to choose the default
	 settings when you install a game like Blood & Magic.

Q:  Why won't the game load?
A:  Make certain that you are in the correct DOS directory (usually
	 C:\INTRPLAY\BAM) when you enter the BAM command.  As stated under
	 System Requirements, you need at least 8Mbs of memory to run the game.
A:  If you have a SoundBlaster AWE32 card and EMM386 is being loaded in
	 your AUTOEXEC.BAT file or your Win95 "Blood & Magic.PIF" file,
     try removing EMM386 and rebooting. Also be sure that the you are
     running the AWEUTIL.EXE that came with your sound software.  This
     should be located in your C:\SB32 directory.

Q:  Do I need to configure EMS or XMS memory?
A:  So long as you have at least 400Kb of available DOS memory, and
	 5Mb of available XMS, then you should run fine.  To check both the
	 total and available memory of your system, enter MEM /C at the C:
	 prompt.

Q:  Will Blood & Magic run under Windows'95?
A:  Yes, BAM will run under Windows'95 DOS Box (minimum 12Mb RAM) but may
	 perform better in DOS mode.

Q:  The intro cinematics pause on the 1st frame, requiring a key press to
     continue.
A:  1) Verify that your computer have at least 8Mb RAM (12Mb under
        Windows 95).
    2) Verify that your sound card configuration is both functional and
        accurate.
    3) Verify that you have at least 5Mb of XMS memory available.

Q:  Why doesn't the sound or music play?
A:  Make sure that your speakers or headphones are plugged in to your PC 
     correctly, and that your speakers are switched on and have power.
     When you finish setting up your sound during the installation routine
     (we recommend the AUTODETECT* option), test both sound effects and
     music.  If everything sounds okay, then select the OK option to save
     your settings.  If you ever need to reconfigure your sound or music, change to the 
     directory where Blood & Magic is located, then run the SNDSETUP
     program.
	 
	 * (If you run AUTODETECT more than once, then the program will assume
     that its first choice was incorrect, and select a different sound
     card. This may result in an incorrect configuration.  To remedy this,
     either continue to run AUTODETECT until the correct settings return,
     or manually configure your sound card)

Q:  Will auto-detection of my sound card work in Windows'95?
A:  Auto-detection of your sound card may be unreliable under Windows'95.  If 
	 you encounter problems using the AUTODETECT function, and you are
     unable to configure your sound card settings manually, then we
     recommend that you restart your computer in DOS mode and try
     AUTODETECT again.  To do this, click on START, then choose SHUTDOWN,        and then choose RESTART IN MS-DOS
	 MODE.  If the option RESTART IN MS-DOS MODE is not available in your 
	 SHUTDOWN menu, then it is likely that your computer does not have a
     full version of DOS installed.

Q:  Why doesn't my Mouse function correctly in the game?
A:  You must have the correct mouse driver loaded before you run Blood
	 & Magic.  The method for doing this can vary from one mouse to the
	 next, so you should consult your system documentation.  If your mouse
	 is behaving erratically during the game, then contact the mouse
	 manufacturer and ask for an updated driver.

Q:  Where can I get help beyond this Troubleshooting section?
A:  Contact Interplay's product support department at 714-553-6678.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT LAST MINUTE NOTES AND KNOWN BUGS:

* Running under Windows 95 DOS Box with only 8 megs RAM:
If your computer has only 8 megs or less of physical RAM (not virtual memory),
you may experience difficulties running BAM from within a Windows 95 DOS box.
Intro cinematics may pause, requiring a key to be pressed before continuing.
Other problems may also be encountered.  In this situation we advise
selecting Restart in DOS Mode, then running BAM.
